Small experiment using Pygame.

A reverse game of Snake, where you play as the food and try to escape the Snake.

Required: pygame, python3
To start: `python3 snake.py`

Controls: WASD

Score is awarded based on how long you survive * how long the snake is.
Being near the snake's head also doesn't award any score (shown with red outline in window)
